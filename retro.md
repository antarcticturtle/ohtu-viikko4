# Techniques for Scrum retrospective
(retrospective = short meeting after sprint to give and receive feedback)

### 1. Glad, Sad, Mad
- Requires cards, whiteboard, up to 60 mins
- all participants list issues from the sprint
- issues are categorized to Glad(positive feedback), Sad(Issues on the team/sprint) and Mad(Issues usually more broad than just the actions of the team)
- Team votes on issues to discuss
- Issues are discussed in order of priority until time runs out


### 2. Start, Stop, Continue, More of, Less of
- Requires flipboard, 10-25 mins
- Facilitator draws a large circle, divides it in the five categories
- Asks for open comments on each category
- issues are discussed as they come
- facilitator writes a short summary of each issue on the respective sector of the circle


2 is faster and goes conversation first, 1 builds up to it and might be a better fit for a more shy team.
